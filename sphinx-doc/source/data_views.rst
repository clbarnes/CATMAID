Using Data Views
================

Introduction
------------

Providing a good entry point to the different data sets served by a
CATMAID instance is important. Depending on number and type of the
projects and stacks, different views on this data might help you with
keeping an overview or to spot the data set you are interested in.
CATMAID's data views try to help you with that. With them you can
define and tweak the front page of CATMAID.

In fact, you can have as many front pages as you want. The ones
available are accessible through a menu, activated by hovering the
*Home* link in the menu. The one used when the CATMAID site is opened,
differs only in one aspect from the others: it is marked as default.
All data views are configured instances of a particular *data view type*.
They define the basic structure of the page, but allow to pass parameters
to adjust some parts.

Currently, CATMAID comes with two pre-defined data views:
*Project list* and *Project table with images*. The latter is used
as the default, i.e. it is shown when CATMAID is loaded. Both views
have different view types. They are *Project list* and *Project table*.
There is also two more data view types that are not used by the
pre-defined views: *Simple project list*. It allows the display of a
project list used before the advent of data views. Then there is also
the *Project tag table* which allows the construction of a table
based on tags. The details are described below.

Different use cases might require different data view types. How to
extend CATMAID and create own data view types is explained in
section :ref:`creating-data-view-types`.

Configuring Data Views
----------------------

To add new or modify the present views, the Django admin interface is
used. By default, you'll find it at *http://<CATMAID-URL>/admin*
or a similar URL. It is not necessarily the case, that every CATMAID
user can administer data views. This depends on the permissions granted and
in case you can't log-in or don't see the relevant parts within the admin
interface, talk to your CATMAID administrator.

In the admin interface you will be presented different configuration
options for CATMAID. Amongst them, the data view management:

.. image:: _static/dataviews/admin_data_views.png

Depending on your CATMAID setup, the admin interface might look a bit
different. Opening the data view configuration will get you a list of
all available data views. By default this looks like this:

.. image:: _static/dataviews/admin_data_views_list.png

Next to the name and the type of each view, the position is visible (1).
With the help of this number you can define the order of the views in
the drop down menu and within this admin view list. The positioning can
be changed right there in the list. If you edited the position numbers, click
*Save* (3) to, well, save your changes. Also indicated is whether a view
is default or not (2). If you want to change this setting, please open up
the configuration of one particular data view (see below). Creating a
new data view can be accomplished by the button in the upper right (4).
The same interface is used for adding new views and editing existing
ones. Editing the default view looks like this:

.. image:: _static/dataviews/admin_data_views_change.png

There are quite some configuration options here: One can easily adjust
the title (1), mark a view as the default (4) or define its position (5).
Setting a data view as the default view, will mark all other views as
non-default at the same time.

If the data view type is changed (2), the help text under the configuration
box (3) is updated accordingly. Every data view type has its own set of
options and the help text will tell you about those. In the case of the
figure above, a *Tabular project view* type is used. A detailed description
of the options available can be found below. The format used to define
them is called `JSON <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON>`_ and in order to
only use the default options you have to set the configuration to ``{}``.
If you enter text that cannot be parsed as JSON you will get an error when
saving. Saving invalid text is thereby prevented. Typos in option names,
however, will not be identified.

If wanted, a comment can be added as well. This will be displayed to
the right of the data view title in the menu.

Different Data View Types
-------------------------

Like said above, a data view type defines the general structure of a
concrete data view, but gives some configuration options. For instance,
most of the types offer to show sample images. If an option is not
present in a data views configuration, its default value is used.

Options in help texts usually have the following notation:

  ``"<name>":[option1|option2]``

An option name has to be quoted and the value has to be delimited by a colon.
However, also values might need quoting if they are strings other than
``true`` or ``false`` (and no numbers). Alternative values are separated by
a logical *or*/pipe symbol (``|``) and only one of them can be used. Let's
have a look at the *sort* option as an example: All data view types, except
the *Simple Project List* type, support the option

  ``"sort":[true|false]``.
 
When set to ``true`` (default), all projects are sorted naturally and when set
to false they are displayed like they come from the database. If we don't
want to have the projects sorted, we could use this configuration:

  ``{"sort":false}``

When multiple options are used, each option is separated by a comma from
another one -- within the same pair of curly braces:

  ``{"name1":opt1, "name2:opt2, ...}``

Like already mentioned, there are options that are supported by all the
different data view types. The only exception to this is the *Simple Project
List* type, which doesn't support such general options. All the other types
respect the following general options:

================== =========================================== ============
Name               Options                                     Default
================== =========================================== ============
``sort``           ``true, false``                             ``true``
``filter_tags``    ``A list of tags, e.g. ["TagA", "TagB"]``   ``[]``
``catalogue_link`` ``true, false``                             ``true``
================== =========================================== ============

With the help of the ``sort`` option one can make sure the list of projects
a data view deals with is sorted (or that it is not). The ``filter_tags``
option allows to define a list of tags that have to be assigned to all
projects looked at. If neuron annotations are used in a project, a so called
neuron catalogue can be displayed. By default, a link to this overview is
displayed for every project that has such annotations. This can be disabled,
by setting the ``catalogue_link`` option to ``false``. If a data view should
get an unsorted list of projects that are tagged with ``Test`` as well as
``CNS`` and catalogue links should not be displayed, the configuration would
look like:

  ``{"sort":false, "filter_tags":["Test", "CNS"], "catalogue_link":false}``

The remainder of this section will briefly discuss the different data view
types available.

Simple Project List
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All data views except this one are processed or the server-side. This project
list is done with the help of JavaScript in the browser of a user. It supports
an interactive live filters for both projects and stacks/stack groups, which can
optionally pre-set with the data view configuration. The ``filter`` option
decides if the filter input boxes are visible.

======================= =========================================== ================
Name                    Options                                     Default
======================= =========================================== ================
``filter``              ``true, false``                             ``true``
``projectFilterTerm``   ``Plain string or regular expression``      ``""``
``stackFilterTerm``     ``Plain string or regular expression``      ``""``
``header``              ``true, false``                             ``true``
``message``             ``String``                                  ``def. message``
``with_stacks``         ``true, false``                             ``true``
``with_stackgroups``    ``true, false``                             ``true``
======================= =========================================== ================

An example:

.. image:: _static/dataviews/admin_data_views_simple_project_list.png

Project List
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The appearance of *Project List* is very similar to the one of
*Simple Project List*. Currently, it doesn't support live filtering of projects,
though. When a project has no stacks, it won't be visible with this view type.
It is processed server-side and offers some configuration options:

======================= =========================================== ================
Name                    Options                                     Default
======================= =========================================== ================
``sort``                ``true, false``                             ``true``
``filter_tags``         ``A list of tags, e.g. ["TagA", "TagB"]``   ``[]``
``catalogue_link``      ``true, false``                             ``true``
``sample_images``       ``true, false``                             ``false``
``sample_mirror_index`` ``position of mirror to use``               ``0``
``sample_stack``        ``stack index, "first", "last"``            ``0``
``sample_slice``        ``slice index, "first", "center", "last"``  ``"center"``
``sample_width``        ``width in pixel, e.g. 50 or 75``           ``orig. width``
``sample_height``       ``height in pixel, e.g. 50 or 75``          ``orig. height``
``show_mirrors``        ``true, false``                             ``false``
======================= =========================================== ================

Please refer to the introduction to this section for an explanation of the
``sort``, ``filter_tags`` and ``catalogue_link`` options. The ``sample_images``
option defines whether there should be a sample image displayed to the left of
each project entry. If an image is displayed, the ``sample_stack`` option
defines from which stack of the current project the image should be taken. The
``stack index`` value of it represents a single integer (e.g. 0). If this index
is out of bounds, no image is displayed. With the option ``sample_slice`` one
defines which slice of the sample stack should be used as sample image. Again,
``slice index`` is an integer number and no image is shown if this is not
within bounds. The option values ``"first"`` and ``"last"`` refer to the first
and last slice of the stack, ``"center'`` refers to the middle slice is the stack.
To make the sample images appear smaller or larger, the ``sample_width`` and
``sample_height`` option can be used. The assigned number is treated as pixel
width and height, respectively. If a sample image is used, a particular mirror
can be selected using the ``sample_mirror_index`` field. The mirror with the
selected position will be used.

So if you were to configure a *Project List* data view with a sample image
which should be the middle slice of every last stack in a project, you would
do this:

  ``{"sample_images":true, "sample_stack":"last", "sample_slice":"center"}``

The result could look like the following:

.. image:: _static/dataviews/admin_data_views_project_list.png

Project table
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While the *Project List* presents all the stacks of a project as links below
each other, the *Project table* will list all stacks in the same row as the
project name. Especially when there are many projects, this helps to get an
overview of all available image data. It allows the display of images
as well, but in a different way than the *Project List* type. Instead of
providing one image per project, this data view type will show one image per
stack -- replacing the stack name. Like the *Project List* type, it won't
show a project, if it has no stacks associated. The following options are
supported:

======================= =========================================== ================
Name                    Options                                     Default
======================= =========================================== ================
``sort``                ``true, false``                             ``true``
``filter_tags``         ``A list of tags, e.g. ["TagA", "TagB"]``   ``[]``
``catalogue_link``      ``true, false``                             ``true``
``sample_images``       ``true, false``                             ``false``
``sample_mirror_index`` ``position of mirror to use``               ``0``
``sample_slice``        ``slice index, "first", "center", "last"``  ``"center"``
``sample_width``        ``width in pixel, e.g. 50 or 75``           ``orig. width``
``sample_height``       ``height in pixel, e.g. 50 or 75``          ``orig. height``
``show_mirrors``        ``true, false``                             ``false``
======================= =========================================== ================

Have a look to this section's introduction for an explanation of the ``sort``,
``filter_tags`` and ``catalogue_link``  options. If images should be
displayed, the ``sample_images`` option should be set to ``true``. Since there
is one image per stack, an option like ``sample_stack`` in the *Project list*
type, isn't needed. However, with the help of the ``sample_slice`` option a
slice can be selected. Again, this can be done with an integer index or one
of the string arguments (mind the quotes!). If the numeric index is out of
range, no image will be displayed. Like in the *Project List* view type, the
option values ``"first"``, ``"center"`` and ``"last"`` refer to the first,
middle and last slice of each stack. To adjust the (pixel) size of sample
image, the options ``sample_width`` and ``sample_height`` can be used. If
only one of the two is used, the images are scaled proportionally. If a sample
image is used, a particular mirror can be selected using the
``sample_mirror_index`` field. The mirror with the selected position will be
used.

If you wanted to display a text-only table, you would actually not need to
define anything, but ``{}`` (because of the defaults) to get something like:

.. image:: _static/dataviews/admin_data_views_project_table_text.png

However, to get an image table with the center slice of each stack where
every sample image has a width of 100px, you would need to define

  ``{"sample_images":true, "sample_slice":"center", "sample_width":100}``

and you would get for example this:

.. image:: _static/dataviews/admin_data_views_project_table.png

Project tag table
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In CATMAID, projects and stacks can be tagged. This can be done through the
admin interface or the tagging tool (see :ref:`tagging-tool`). Based on a
*Project tag table* data view type, a data view can create a table where each
cell is associated with a *row tag* and *column tag*. Which tag is linked to
which row and which tag is linked to which columns can be configured.

To understand the purpose of this data view type, let's look at an example:
You have light microscopy image stacks of different tissues. For every tissue
there are image stacks for multiple proteins you are interested in. To have
the tissue and the protein associated with CATMAID projects, one could just
use tags: Every project would be tagged with a tissue name and protein name.
To organize the data with the help of the *Project tag table* data view type,
one could then assign the tissue tags to the columns and the protein tags
to the rows of the resulting table. Each cell of the table refers then to one
column (tissue) tag and one row (protein) tag. Each project will appear in a
table cell that refers to tags the project itself is tagged with.

However, there are more options than the tags themselves that can be configured:

======================= ========================================== ================
Name                    Options                                    Default
======================= ========================================== ================
``sort``                ``true, false``                            ``true``
``filter_tags``         ``A list of tags, e.g. ["TagA", "TagB"]``  ``[]``
``catalogue_link``      ``true, false``                            ``true``
``row_tags``            ``A list of tags, e.g. ["TagA", "TagB"]``  ``[]``
``col_tags``            ``A list of tags, e.g. ["TagA", "TagB"]``  ``[]``
``linked_stacks``       ``stack index, "first", "last", "all"``    ``"all"``
``force_stack_list``    ``true, false``                            ``false``
``highlight_tags``      ``A list of tags, e.g. ["TagA", "TagB"]``  ``[]``
``sample_images``       ``true, false``                            ``false``
``sample_mirror_index`` ``position of mirror to use``              ``0``
``sample_slice``        ``slice index, "first", "center", "last"`` ``"center"``
``sample_width``        ``width in pixel, e.g. 50 or 75``          ``orig. width``
``sample_height``       ``height in pixel, e.g. 50 or 75``         ``orig. height``
======================= ========================================== ================

Have a look at this section's introduction for an explanation of the ``sort``,
``filter_tags`` and ``catalogue_link`` options. The tags to use for the rows
and columns can be set with the ``row_tags`` and the ``col_tags`` keywords.
To control which stacks of a project appear in a table cell, the
``linked_stacks`` and the ``force_stack_list`` option can be used: They define
if a list of stacks is displayed per project (like in the *Project list* type)
and which stacks should make it into this list. By default, a complete stack
list is displayed for each project. In some situations, however, it is not
preferable to list all stacks associated with a project and so you can limit
this to either the ``first`` stack, the ``last`` or one of a specific index.
Is there only one stack (selected or at all), then the link to open it is
rendered solely as the project title and no list is displayed. If this is not
wanted, the ``force_stack_list`` option can be set to true to get a list with
one entry.

It may be desirable to highlight a group of projects which have the same tags.
This can be achieved by providing ``highlight_tags``. All projects tagged with
at least one of those tags will be displayed in bold.

Like with the other data types, one can opt for showing images instead of stack
names. To do so, employ the ``sample_images`` option. These images will then
form links to the actual stack display. With the help of the ``sample_slice``
keyword, the displayed slice can be selected. Again, one can choose the
``"first"``, ``"last"`` or ``"center"`` slice of the stack. In case the default
size of these sample is too big or too small, the ``sample_width`` and
``sample_height`` options can be used. It takes a numerical pixel value and
scales the result images accordingly. If a sample image is used, a particular
mirror can be selected using the ``sample_mirror_index`` field. The mirror with
the selected position will be used.

As an example, consider the situation described above: We have image stacks
of several tissues and with multiple protein markers. The imaged tissues are
*CNS* and *salivary gland*. For both of them there are stacks labeled with
markers called *Smo* and *Ptc*. The stacks have been labeled accordingly.
Also, we only want to consider images tagged as "Valid". Additionally, we
don't went to see all the stacks, but only the project name that links to the
last stack of each project. A configuration might look like this::

   {"filter_tags":["Valid"], "row_tags":["Smo", "Ptc"],
   "col_tags":["CNS", "Salivary Gland"], "linked_stacks":"last" }

With this, the rendered result could look like the following:

.. image:: _static/dataviews/admin_data_views_project_tag_table.png
